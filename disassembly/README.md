I disassembled the [6502 machine code](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/tree/main/original-hex) for the Compukit UK101 computer, using [an online browser-based 6502 disassembly tool](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/disassembler.html).

I then edited and reformatted the disassembled code, and the result was the file [*assembly.txt*](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/blob/main/disassembly/assembly.txt), which can be reassembled by [beebasm](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm) into a binary file whose contents are identical to those of the orignal hex (after adjusting for the plain-text format of the latter).
