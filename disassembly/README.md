I disassembled the 6502 machine code for the Compukit UK101 computer using [an online browser-based 6502 disassembly tool](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/disassembler.html).

I then edited and reformatted the disassembled code so that it could be reassembled by beebasm into a binary file whose contents were identical to those of the orignal hex (after adjusting for the plain-text format of the latter).
