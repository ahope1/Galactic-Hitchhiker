# Conversion to the BBC Micro

I edited my reconstructed assembly code for the Compukit UK101 version of the game Galactic Hitchhiker and adapted it into a version ([*beebify assembly.txt*](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/blob/main/beebify/beebify%20assembly.txt)) that would run on the BBC Micro. Large chunks of the assembly code are unchanged because they can run unaltered on both the UK101 and the BBC Micro.
