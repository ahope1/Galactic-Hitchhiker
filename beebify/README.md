# Conversion to the BBC Micro

I edited [my reconstructed assembly code](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/tree/main/disassembly) for the Compukit UK101 game Galactic Hitchhiker in order to adapt it into a version ([*beebify assembly.txt*](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/blob/main/beebify/beebify%20assembly.txt)) which, once assembled by [*beebasm*](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm), would run on a BBC Micro. 

Large chunks of the assembly code are unchanged because they were already compatible with both the UK101 and the BBC Micro. 

Click [this link](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/commit/5652229d51ea682a2fcbd538a720b9c07396810b) to see the main differences between the UK101 code and the BBC Micro code. (By now, I may have made further changes, subsequent to those revealed by that link â€” see [the full commit history](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/commits/main/beebify/beebify%20assembly.txt) for details.) Essentially, I've just searched for any "API calls" to the UK101 BASIC ROM and replaced them with calls to the equivalent routines in the BBC Micro OS. 

**I haven't fully analysed or commented the game-logic or the encoding of the game-data yet.**

The "bin..." files (which are referred to in [*beebify assembly.txt*](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/blob/main/beebify/beebify%20assembly.txt)) can be found in the [*disassembly*](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/tree/main/disassembly) folder.

The file [*ght.ssd*](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/blob/main/beebify/ght.ssd) is a BBC Micro disc-image that serves as a template for the final disc-image on which [*beebasm*](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm) will store the assembled game code.

Here's the *beebasm* command that will assemble the code and generate the final playable disc-image ([*gh.ssd*](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/blob/main/beebify/gh.ssd)): 

*beebasm -v -i beebify\ assembly.txt -di ght.ssd -do gh.ssd -o gh*
