# Conversion to the BBC Micro

I edited my reconstructed assembler code for the Compukit UK101 version of the game Galactic Hitchhiker and adapted it into a version that would run on the BBC Micro. Click [this link](https://github.com/ahope1/Galactic-Hitchhiker/commit/5652229d51ea682a2fcbd538a720b9c07396810b) to see the main changes. (I may since have made further changes, subsequent to those revealed by that link.)
