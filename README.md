# Galactic Hitchhiker

[**>>> Play the BBC Micro version online <<<**](http://bbcmicro.co.uk//jsbeeb/play.php?autoboot&disc=http://bbcmicro.co.uk//gameimg/discs/1411/gh.ssd&noseek)

This repository documents my conversion of the game Galactic Hitchhiker from the original version for the Compukit 101 computer to a minimally altered version that will run on the BBC Micro computer. 

Both the Compukit 101 and the BBC Micro are built around the 6502 CPU, and therefore the game, which has been distributed as 6502 machine code for the UK101, only needed fairly minor changes to make it run on a BBC Micro. Still, seeing that I'd only ever dabbled in 6502 machine code previously — let alone disassembly and reassembly — the conversion process was still quite a challenge for me personally.
