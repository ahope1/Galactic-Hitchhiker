This repository documents my conversion of the 1980 game [Galactic Hitchhiker](https://bluerenga.blog/2021/11/04/galactic-hitchhiker-1980/) from the original version for the Compukit 101 computer to a minimally altered version that will run on the BBC Micro computer. 

Both the Compukit 101 and the BBC Micro are built around the [6502 CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502), and therefore the game, which has been distributed as 6502 machine code for the UK101, only needed fairly minor changes to make it run on a BBC Micro. All of the game logic and the game data (messages, room descriptions, etc.) are unchanged.  Still, seeing that I'd only ever dabbled in 6502 machine code previously — let alone in disassembly and reassembly — the conversion process was still quite a challenge for me personally.
